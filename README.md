When you pixelate an image with the pixelator, the target height and width should be divisors of the original ones (example: turn a 128x128 image into 64x64, not 60x64) otherwise you get squished/stretched pixels.

Updated Fork now allows for mor granular control of the pixel grid. Also allows the user to move the picture under the grid.
