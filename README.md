When you pixelate an image with the pixelator, the target height and width should be divisors of the original ones (example: turn a 128x128 image into 64x64, not 60x64) otherwise you get squished/stretched pixels.

Updated Fork now allows for more granular control of the pixel-grid-overlay-tool.
Allows the user to move the picture under the grid
Allows the user to change the picture size
Allows the user to save the picture+grid as a .PNG
Added sliders.
